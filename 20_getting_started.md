## Getting Started with knife-zero.

You have 2 servers, production and development.

- servers have public ip address. (Please replace your IPs.)
    - server1: 153.120.97.132 (development)
    - server2: 153.120.97.133 (production)
- ssh login user is `ubuntu` which can sudo.

### Setup Chef-Repo

First, create your Chef repository.

```
$ mkdir my_chef_repo
$ cd my_chef_repo
$ touch ./knife.rb
```

Write settings into `knife.rb`.

```ruby
local_mode true
chef_repo_path   File.expand_path('../' , __FILE__)

knife[:ssh_attribute] = "knife_zero.host"
knife[:use_sudo] = true

## use specific key file to connect server instead of ssh_agent(use ssh_agent is set true by default).
# knife[:identity_file] = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"

## Attributes of node objects will be saved to json file.
## the automatic_attribute_whitelist option limits the attributes to be saved.
knife[:automatic_attribute_whitelist] = %w[
  fqdn
  os
  os_version
  hostname
  ipaddress
  roles
  recipes
  ipaddress
  platform
  platform_version
  cloud
  cloud_v2
  chef_packages
]
```

### Bootstrap servers

Bootstrapping development server. Unless otherwise stated, all commands have been running on the workstation.

> If you going to using version 15.x on the Chef Infra Client on the remote node, add the `--chef-license accept` option.

```
$ knife zero bootstrap 153.120.97.132 --ssh-user ubuntu

```

Bootstrap does the following.

- Installs Omnibus-Chef to remote node.
- Create files for chef-client run.
- Run chef-client once.

These process will not affect to almost server's behavior.

There are created files in `/etc/chef` below by default. This behavior is same as chef-server/client environment.

```
(server1) $ sudo find /etc/chef
/etc/chef
/etc/chef/first-boot.json
/etc/chef/client.pem
/etc/chef/validation.pem
/etc/chef/client.rb
```

Node object will be created in `./nodes/` under current directory as json file.  
And, We can manage with knife command.

```
$ ls nodes/server1.json
nodes/server1.json


$ knife node show server1
Node Name:   server1
Environment: _default
FQDN:        
IP:          153.120.97.132
Run List:    
Roles:       
Recipes:     
Platform:    ubuntu 12.04
Tags:        
```

If you would like to use another `Node Name` of remote server, we can use specific name of it by passing `--node--name` option.

```
$ knife zero bootstrap 153.120.97.132 --ssh-user ubuntu --node-name develop-server
...

$ knife node list
develop-server

$ knife node show develop-server
Node Name:   develop-server
Environment: _default
FQDN:        
IP:          153.120.97.132
Run List:    
Roles:       
Recipes:     
Platform:    ubuntu 12.04
Tags:        
```

Similarly, also bootstrap production server.

```
$ knife zero bootstrap 153.120.97.133 --ssh-user ubuntu --node-name production-server

...


$ knife node list
develop-server
production-server


$ knife node show production-server
Node Name:   production-server
Environment: _default

```

### Search and SSH

We can search and run command via ssh.

- [knife search — Chef Docs](https://docs.chef.io/knife_search.html "knife search — Chef Docs")
- [knife ssh — Chef Docs](https://docs.chef.io/knife_ssh.html "knife ssh — Chef Docs")

Search with attributes.

```
$ knife search node "name:dev*"

### Converge

Next, we can run chef-client on remote servers by `zero converge` without any changes.

```
$ knife zero converge "name:*" --ssh-user ubuntu
153.120.97.132 sudo: unable to resolve host server1
153.120.97.133 sudo: unable to resolve host server2

```

Now, we have prepared to manage by chef.

> Note:  
> Remember, we don't have to use recipes to manage servers.  
> It is possible that we can manage simply with using `knife (ssh|search|node list)` without converge.  
> In other words, we can use chef-repository which is created by Knife-Zero as just management ledger.

### Create recipe and apply it.

OK, let's edit our Chef-Repo and manage servers.

Create cookbook `create_file` to `./cookbooks/`.

```
$ knife cookbook create create_file
** Creating cookbook create_file in /Users/sawanoboriyu/bitbucket/sawanoboly/knife-zero.gettingstarted/cookbooks
** Creating README for cookbook: create_file
** Creating CHANGELOG for cookbook: create_file
** Creating metadata for cookbook: create_file
```

And edit `cookbooks/create_file/recipes/default.rb` like below.

```ruby
file '/tmp/myenvironment' do
  content node.chef_environment
end
```

Converge `develop-server` by `--override-runlist` option.

```
$ knife zero converge "name:develop-server" --ssh-user ubuntu --override-runlist create_file
153.120.97.132 sudo: unable to resolve host server1

It creates file on remote server.

```
(server1)$ cat /tmp/myenvironment

```

`--override-runlist` doesn't update local node file. Run-List of node was leave empty.

```
$ knife node show develop-server

If we want to register recipe to node permanently, should use `node run_list add`.

- `knife node run_list add [NODE] [ENTRY[,ENTRY]] (options)`

```
$ knife node run_list add develop-server create_file
develop-server:
  run_list: recipe[create_file]

$ knife node show develop-server

$ knife zero converge "name:develop-server" -x ubuntu

Managing nodes with knife-zero workflow is almost same as Chef-Server and Client usage. Please see official document to learn more.

- [knife node — Chef Docs](https://docs.chef.io/knife_node.html "knife node — Chef Docs")

#### assigning environments

Create two environments, `development` and `production`.

```
$ knife environment create development --disable-editing
Created development

$ knife environment create production --disable-editing
Created production


$ ls -1 environments/
development.json
production.json
```

- [About Environments — Chef Docs](https://docs.chef.io/environments.html "About Environments — Chef Docs")


We can assign specific environment each nodes by `node environment set`.

- `knife node environment set NODE ENVIRONMENT`

```
$ knife node environment set develop-server development
develop-server:
  chef_environment: development

$ knife node environment set production-server production
production-server:
  chef_environment: production
```

Search key of environment is `chef_environment`.

```
$ knife search node "chef_environment:production"
1 items found

Node Name:   production-server
Environment: production
FQDN:        
IP:          153.120.97.133
Run List:    
Roles:       
Recipes:     
Platform:    ubuntu 12.04
Tags:        
```

Next, set same recipes to production-server.

```
$ knife node run_list add production-server create_file
production-server:
  run_list: recipe[create_file]
```

Converge all servers. It runs same recipe to two servers, but result depends on their environment.

If there is that if you are in trouble, First, let's check the official document. Again, Knife-Zero is the same as the Chef-Server environment.
